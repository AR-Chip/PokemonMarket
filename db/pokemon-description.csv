https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/001.png,There is a plant seed on its back right from the day this Pokémon is born. The seed slowly grows larger.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/002.png,"When the bulb on its back grows large, it appears to lose the ability to stand on its hind legs."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/003.png,Its plant blooms when it is absorbing solar energy. It stays on the move to seek sunlight.

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/005.png,"It has a barbaric nature. In battle, it whips its fiery tail around and slashes away with sharp claws."

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/010.png,"For protection, it releases a horrible stench from the antenna on its head to drive away enemies."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/011.png,"It is waiting for the moment to evolve. At this stage, it can only harden, so it remains motionless to avoid attack."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/012.png,It loves the nectar of flowers and can locate flower patches that have even tiny amounts of pollen.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/013.png,Beware of the sharp stinger on its head. It hides in grass and bushes where it eats leaves.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/014.png,"Able to move only slightly. When endangered, it may stick out its stinger and poison its enemy."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/015.png,It has three poisonous stingers on its forelegs and its tail. They are used to jab its enemy repeatedly.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/016.png,"Very docile. If attacked, it will often kick up sand to protect itself rather than fight back."

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/022.png,"A Pokémon that dates back many years. If it senses danger, it flies high and away, instantly."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/023.png,"The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/024.png,The frightening patterns on its belly have been studied. Six variations have been confirmed.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/025.png,"When it is angered, it immediately discharges the energy stored in the pouches in its cheeks."

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/029.png,"Females are more sensitive to smells than males. While foraging, they’ll use their whiskers to check wind direction and stay downwind of predators."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/030.png,The horn on its head has atrophied. It’s thought that this happens so Nidorina’s children won’t get poked while their mother is feeding them.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/031.png,"Nidoqueen is better at defense than offense. With scales like armor, this Pokémon will shield its children from any kind of attack."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/032.png,"The horn on a male Nidoran’s forehead contains a powerful poison. This is a very cautious Pokémon, always straining its large ears."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/033.png,"With a horn that’s harder than diamond, this Pokémon goes around shattering boulders as it searches for a moon stone."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/034.png,"When it goes on a rampage, it’s impossible to control. But in the presence of a Nidoqueen it’s lived with for a long time, Nidoking calms down."

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/040.png,"It has a very fine fur. Take care not to make it angry, or it may inflate steadily and hit with a body slam."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/041.png,"It emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to check its surroundings. Even in tight caves, Zubat flies around with skill."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/042.png,"It loves to drink other creatures’ blood. It’s said that if it finds others of its kind going hungry, it sometimes shares the blood it’s gathered."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/043.png,"If exposed to moonlight, it starts to move. It roams far and wide at night to scatter its seeds."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/044.png,Its pistils exude an incredibly foul odor. The horrid stench can cause fainting at a distance of 1.25 miles.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/045.png,"It has the world’s largest petals. With every step, the petals shake out heavy clouds of toxic pollen."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/046.png,Burrows under the ground to gnaw on tree roots. The mushrooms on its back absorb most of the nutrition.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/047.png,The bug host is drained of energy by the mushroom on its back. The mushroom appears to do all the thinking.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/048.png,Poison oozes from all over its body. It catches small bug Pokémon at night that are attracted by light.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/049.png,"The wings are covered with dustlike scales. Every time it flaps its wings, it looses highly toxic dust."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/050.png,"It lives about one yard underground, where it feeds on plant roots. It sometimes appears aboveground."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/051.png,"Its three heads bob separately up and down to loosen the soil nearby, making it easier for it to burrow."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/052.png,"All it does is sleep during the daytime. At night, it patrols its territory with its eyes aglow."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/053.png,"Although its fur has many admirers, it is tough to raise as a pet because of its fickle meanness."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/054.png,"It is constantly wracked by a headache. When the headache turns intense, it begins using mysterious powers."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/055.png,"When it swims at full speed using its long, webbed limbs, its forehead somehow begins to glow."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/056.png,"It lives in groups in the treetops. If it loses sight of its group, it becomes infuriated by its loneliness."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/057.png,It becomes wildly furious if it even senses someone looking at it. It chases anyone that meets its glare.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/058.png,It has a brave and trustworthy nature. It fearlessly stands up to bigger and stronger foes.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/059.png,An ancient picture scroll shows that people were captivated by its movement as it ran through prairies.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/060.png,"For Poliwag, swimming is easier than walking. The swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of the Pokémon’s innards showing through the skin."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/061.png,Staring at the swirl on its belly causes drowsiness. This trait of Poliwhirl’s has been used in place of lullabies to get children to go to sleep.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/062.png,"Its body is solid muscle. When swimming through cold seas, Poliwrath uses its impressive arms to smash through drift ice and plow forward."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/063.png,This Pokémon uses its psychic powers while it sleeps. The contents of Abra’s dreams affect the powers that the Pokémon wields.
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/064.png,"Using its psychic power, Kadabra levitates as it sleeps. It uses its springy tail as a pillow."

https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/100.png,"It rolls to move. If the ground is uneven, a sudden jolt from hitting a bump can cause it to explode."
https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/101.png,"The more energy it charges up, the faster it gets. But this also makes it more likely to explode."
